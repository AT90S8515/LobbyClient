# LobbyClient

## Development

To start building LobbyClient, follow these steps:
- Clone the repository to a local folder.
- `cd` into the folder and install npm packages using `npm install`.

Once this is done, you can start the Webpack dev server using `npm run-script watch` and the actual application with `npm start`. When you update a file, Webpack will automatically compile the bundle and reload the application.
